2C=16.5 c=8.25 
use a battery that has at least c as a factor of safety=10
max discharge current =16.5
needed voltage =12
for this use i would use this battery:
https://www.dnkpower.com/products/12v-10ah-lithium-ion-battery-pack-dnk-ct12350b/

as it has the minimum c as well as the required voltage and exceeds the max discharge rate needed and is compact and lightweight and isn't costly
